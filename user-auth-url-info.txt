1. create user after signing up either with either google or facebook or userid/pwd. You will get error if user already exist
(use this to create a new user, if the user exists, you will get an error) or else it will return you the user object with display fields, search fields information. you can use this to display fields on the grid. Also the returned json will have the urls for the crud, currently only listurl is available and it will return you the right url
create user url(POST): https://user-auth.the3dsoft.com/users/v1/user
